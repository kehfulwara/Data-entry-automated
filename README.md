# Automating Data Entry with Web Scraping
Inspiration and Context
The inspiration for this project came from browsing the r/Python subreddit, a great community to see what others are building with Python and to stay updated on Python news. One post asked if anyone had completely automated their job using Python.

Many people have successfully automated their jobs, especially data entry roles, by using Python with tools like Beautiful Soup and Selenium. These jobs often involve moving data from one format to another, making them ideal for automation.
# Project Overview
In this project, we will tackle a research data entry job involving house prices that meet specific criteria for a client on the Zillow website. The data will then be transferred into a form that creates a Google Sheets spreadsheet.

This project will utilize everything learned in this section, including Beautiful Soup and Selenium.
The project involves scraping house rental data from a Zillow clone website using Beautiful Soup.
Selenium will be used to automatically fill out a Google Form with the scraped data.
This project combines skills learned in web scraping with Beautiful Soup and Selenium to create a practical automation solution.
